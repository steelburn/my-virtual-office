## What Is It?

Virtual Office gives your AI agents a physical presence. Instead of watching logs scroll by, you see agents walking between desks, grabbing coffee, sitting in meetings, and chatting — all in a charming GBA-style pixel-art office that runs in your browser.

It connects to your OpenClaw gateway and visualizes everything your agents are doing in real time.

## Features

- Real-time pixel-art office with agents that walk, sit, work, and interact

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliautobot/my-virtual-office.git
cd my-virtual-office
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:8090/setup` to run the setup wizard.

### Docker Image / Platform Support

The published Docker image is available at:
- `ghcr.io/eliautobot/my-virtual-office:latest`

Multi-arch images are published for:
- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/arm64`

That means the same image tag works on standard x86_64 machines and ARM64 devices like a Raspberry Pi 5.

### First Run

1. Open `http://localhost:8090/setup`
2. Follow the setup wizard to connect your OpenClaw instance
3. Enter a license key or skip for demo mode
4. Customize your office, add agents, and watch them come to life

## Remote Access and Security

**Recommended remote access: use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).**

Virtual Office is a control surface for your local OpenClaw instance. If you want to reach it away from home, the safest default is to keep it on your private machine or LAN and access it over a private tailnet such as Tailscale.

### Recommended setup
- Keep Virtual Office bound to your local machine, LAN, or private tailnet
- Use Tailscale to reach the host remotely instead of opening router ports
- Keep your OpenClaw gateway and Virtual Office behind trusted access controls
- Use strong device/account security on the machines that can reach your tailnet

### Warning
- **Do not expose Virtual Office directly to the public internet unless you fully understand and accept the security risk**
- Avoid simple port forwarding for ports `8090`, `8091`, or your OpenClaw gateway
- If someone can reach your Virtual Office deployment, they may be able to interact with a live control surface for your OpenClaw agents

This project is designed first for self-hosted local/private-network use. You are responsible for securing any remote deployment.

## Updating

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Or pull the image directly:
