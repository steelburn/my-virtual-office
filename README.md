# My Virtual Office

🌐 **[myvirtualoffice.ai](https://myvirtualoffice.ai/)**

A self-hosted 2D AI workspace for AI Agents. Turn invisible agent work into a living, breathing office.

## What Is It?

Virtual Office gives your AI agents a physical presence. Instead of watching logs scroll by, you see agents walking between desks, grabbing coffee, sitting in meetings, and chatting in a charming 2D style office that runs in your browser.

It connects to supported agent harnesses and visualizes what your agents are doing in real time.

## Supported Agent Harnesses

### OpenClaw

Virtual Office connects to OpenClaw through the OpenClaw gateway and the mounted OpenClaw home directory. The gateway provides live chat and activity events, while the home directory lets Virtual Office discover agents, read safe profile metadata, load model settings, and surface workspace tools in the UI.

For Docker deployments, mount your OpenClaw home directory into the container and set `VO_OPENCLAW_PATH`, `VO_GATEWAY_URL`, and `VO_GATEWAY_HTTP` when the defaults do not match your setup.

### Hermes Agents

Virtual Office can discover local Hermes Agent profiles as first-class office agents when the Hermes CLI and home directory are available to the app. It uses conservative Hermes CLI surfaces for discovery and status, sends chat messages through `hermes -z` with the selected profile, captures replies from stdout, and stores local Virtual Office history under `VO_STATUS_DIR`.

For Docker deployments, mount or otherwise expose the Hermes home directory and CLI path to the container, then set `VO_HERMES_HOME` and `VO_HERMES_BIN` accordingly. Hermes secrets, private memory files, raw logs, and config internals are not read or exposed by default.

### Codex

Virtual Office can create Codex-backed office agents when the Codex CLI is available to the app. Chat uses Codex's native `codex app-server` JSON-RPC protocol for thread start/resume, live progress, and interrupt support. `codex exec` is retained only as an explicit compatibility fallback.

Discovery includes Virtual Office-created Codex agents, Codex's standard `$CODEX_HOME/agents/*.toml` custom agents, and a synthesized `Main` entry for the default Codex root agent. Newly created Virtual Office Codex agents can use the default Codex agents directory or a custom parent directory. Default-directory creation registers a native custom-agent TOML file under `$CODEX_HOME/agents` when `VO_CODEX_REGISTER_NATIVE_AGENTS=1`; custom-directory creation writes a project-local `.codex/agents/<profile>.toml` and keeps a small Virtual Office registry so the agent remains discoverable.

For Docker deployments, install Codex inside the container image or set `VO_CODEX_BIN` to a Codex executable path available inside the container. Set `VO_CODEX_HOME` to a deployment-specific Codex home so auth and config stay out of the repo and are not tied to any developer's machine. Useful variables: `VO_CODEX_BIN`, `VO_CODEX_HOME`, `VO_CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, `VO_CODEX_MAIN_WORKSPACE`, `VO_CODEX_INCLUDE_MAIN`, `VO_CODEX_INCLUDE_NATIVE_AGENTS`, `VO_CODEX_REGISTER_NATIVE_AGENTS`, `VO_CODEX_PREFER_APP_SERVER`, and `VO_CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY`.

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliautobot/my-virtual-office.git
cd my-virtual-office
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:8090/setup` to run the setup wizard.

### Docker Image / Platform Support

The published Docker image is available at:
- `ghcr.io/eliautobot/my-virtual-office:latest`

Multi-arch images are published for:
- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/arm64`

That means the same image tag works on standard x86_64 machines and ARM64 devices like a Raspberry Pi 5.

### First Run

1. Open `http://localhost:8090/setup`
2. Follow the setup wizard to connect your OpenClaw instance, Hermes Agents, or both
3. Enter a license key or skip for demo mode
4. Customize your office, add agents, and watch them come to life

## Remote Access and Security

**Recommended remote access: use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).**

Virtual Office is a control surface for your local agent harnesses. If you want to reach it away from home, the safest default is to keep it on your private machine or LAN and access it over a private tailnet such as Tailscale.

### Recommended setup
- Keep Virtual Office bound to your local machine, LAN, or private tailnet
- Use Tailscale to reach the host remotely instead of opening router ports
- Keep your agent harnesses and Virtual Office behind trusted access controls
- Use strong device/account security on the machines that can reach your tailnet

### Warning
- **Do not expose Virtual Office directly to the public internet unless you fully understand and accept the security risk**
- Avoid simple port forwarding for ports `8090`, `8091`, or your agent harness gateways
- If someone can reach your Virtual Office deployment, they may be able to interact with a live control surface for your agents

This project is designed first for self-hosted local/private-network use. You are responsible for securing any remote deployment.
