# Virtual Office Agent Tools

Status: canonical agent-facing tool index  
Scope: My Virtual Office Product

## Purpose

This document is the organized index for tools that agents can use through My Virtual Office. It avoids duplicate scattered instructions and points every platform toward the same office-owned surfaces.

The companion architecture document is `docs/UNIVERSAL-AGENT-HARNESS-SPEC.md`.

## Built-in skills

Virtual Office seeds these skills into the Skills Library so agents can learn how to use office tools without custom platform code:

- `AgentPlatform-to-AgentPlatform_Communications`
- `VirtualOffice-Presence-and-Status`
- `VirtualOffice-Browser-Control`
- `VirtualOffice-Meetings`
- `VirtualOffice-Projects-and-Tasks`

Skills Library endpoints:

- `GET /api/skills-library`
- `GET /api/skills-library/<skill-name>`
- `POST /api/skills-library/apply`

The raw cross-platform communication skill is also exposed at:

- `GET /api/agent-platform-communications/skill`

## Tool surfaces

### Agent platforms

Use when the office needs to create or remove agents on a connected platform.

- `GET /api/agent-platforms`
- `POST /api/agent/create`
- `DELETE /api/agent/delete`

`POST /api/agent/create` accepts `platform: "openclaw"`, `platform: "hermes"`, or `platform: "codex"`. OpenClaw creation goes through Gateway `agents.create` / `agents.files.set` so the agent is runnable immediately and files are owned by the OpenClaw user. Hermes creation maps one office agent to one Hermes profile and uses `hermes profile create/delete`. Codex creation maps one office agent to a Codex workspace, writes `AGENTS.md` plus `.codex/agents/<profile>.toml`, and chats through Codex's native app-server JSON-RPC protocol. `codex exec` is only a compatibility fallback when app-server is explicitly disabled.

Codex creation supports two location modes:

- `codexCreationMode: "standard"`: create under configured `codex.workspaceRoot` and register `$CODEX_HOME/agents/<profile>.toml` when native registration is enabled.
- `codexCreationMode: "custom"` with `codexCustomDirectory`: create `<codexCustomDirectory>/<profile>` and write project-local `.codex/agents/<profile>.toml`. Virtual Office stores a registry entry under `codex.workspaceRoot` so the custom agent remains discoverable.

Codex discovery also reads the standard `$CODEX_HOME/agents/*.toml` custom-agent directory and includes a synthesized `codex-main` entry for Codex's default Main agent.

Codex configuration is product-neutral:

- `VO_CODEX_BIN`: Codex CLI executable, default `codex` on `PATH`
- `VO_CODEX_HOME`: Codex auth/config home for this deployment, default `VO_STATUS_DIR/codex-home` in Docker
- `VO_CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT`: Office-created Codex agent workspaces
- `VO_CODEX_MAIN_WORKSPACE`: Workspace used by `codex-main` and native custom agents
- `VO_CODEX_INCLUDE_MAIN`: include Codex's default Main agent, enabled by default
- `VO_CODEX_INCLUDE_NATIVE_AGENTS`: read `$CODEX_HOME/agents/*.toml`, enabled by default
- `VO_CODEX_REGISTER_NATIVE_AGENTS`: write `$CODEX_HOME/agents/<profile>.toml` when creating VO Codex agents, enabled by default
- `VO_CODEX_PREFER_APP_SERVER`: native app-server integration on by default
- `VO_CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY`: Codex approval policy, default `never` so unattended Office runs do not hang on approval prompts

Never hardcode host usernames, personal auth paths, or a developer's local container layout into Codex product support.

### AgentPlatform-to-AgentPlatform Communications

Use when agents need to talk across providers and the exchange should be visible in Virtual Office.

- `POST /api/agent-platform-communications/send`
- `GET /api/agent-platform-communications/history`

Events are stored in:

- `VO_STATUS_DIR/agent-platform-communications.jsonl`

These events are merged into `/agent-chat`, so chat bubbles can show cross-platform interactions.

### Presence and status

Virtual Office derives live presence from gateway/session activity. Use these
endpoints when an external adapter or broker needs to set an explicit visible
state that cannot be inferred automatically.

- `GET /api/presence`
- `GET /status`
- `POST /api/presence/<agentId>`

Allowed common states:

- `working`
- `idle`
- `break`
- `meeting`

### Browser control

Current safe read/status endpoints:

- `GET /browser-status`
- `GET /browser-tabs`
- `GET /browser-controller`

Important: agents should not use raw Kasm/CDP credentials directly. A provider-neutral browser action API should be added before non-OpenClaw agents are given direct browser control.

### Meetings

- `GET /api/meetings/active`
- `GET /api/meetings/history`
- `POST /api/meetings/create`
- `POST /api/meetings/end`
- `POST /api/meetings/end-all`

Meetings should always end with a summary/resolution/action items.

### Projects and tasks

- `GET /api/projects`
- `GET /api/projects/<projectId>`
- `POST /api/projects`
- `POST /api/projects/<projectId>/tasks`
- `PUT /api/projects/<projectId>/tasks/<taskId>`
- `GET /api/projects/<projectId>/workflow/status`
- `POST /api/projects/<projectId>/workflow/start`
- `POST /api/projects/<projectId>/workflow/stop`
- `GET /api/projects/scores`

Use these for durable work that belongs on a board.

## Organization rules

- Use this file as the canonical index.
- Use skill files for concise agent instructions.
- Use provider adapter docs for implementation details.
- Do not duplicate generic browser automation skills as Virtual Office browser skills. `agent-browser` is generic; `VirtualOffice-Browser-Control` is specifically for the office-owned browser surface.
- Future tools should add one section here and one built-in skill only if agents need direct instructions.

## Current gaps

- Provider-neutral browser action endpoint is not implemented yet.
- File/upload tool skill is not yet added; add it only after the intended agent-facing file endpoints are finalized.
- Calendar/scheduler skill is not yet added; add it only if Virtual Office owns those endpoints instead of delegating to OpenClaw/provider tools.
